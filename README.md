# StudentManagementSystem

## Description

This is a basic Student Management System built in Java. It simulates managing student data such as name, age, address, student ID, major, and GPA. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and constructors.

## Features

- The system has two main classes: `Person` and `Student`.
  - `Person` class holds basic information like name, age, and address.
  - `Student` class extends `Person` and adds additional information such as student ID, major, and GPA.
  
- The system uses an `ArrayList` to store and manage student records.
- Students are assigned a unique student ID automatically.
- The user can add a new student, display all students' details, and search for a student by their ID.

## How to Run

1. Download the project files.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or your preferred Java IDE.
3. Make sure you have JDK (Java Development Kit) installed.
4. Open a terminal and run the following command to compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
After compiling, run the program using:
java StudentManagementSystem
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system (add students, display details, search by ID, etc.).
This project helped me understand how to work with classes, constructors, methods, and inheritance in Java. It also gave me hands-on experience with managing user input, arrays, and using basic data structures in Java.
